# Melody-Generator
The melody generator is a tool for musicians who get stuck in writing or simply want to generate random results quickly to help with their workflow. It generates a random melody on the basis of a previously chosen scale. The melody is audible by clicking the 'generate melody' button and subsequently appears as notes below the button. 

The next steps in development are: 
- including all scales
- displaying the melody as music notation
- integrating music theory to generate more musical results
